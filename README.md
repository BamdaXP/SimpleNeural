# Simple Neural Nextwork
A basic framework to construct a neural network system.

In example,I used it to classify texts.(It is not well constructed)

## Dependencies
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit learn(Used to fetch text training source)

## To do
* ~~Sine function is well predicted~~
* Text classifier did not work well,accuracy remains about 30%(Considering reconstructing the network)
